    "We will now work through how a vertex zone is created and how the minimum distance calculations are done for the grid points that exist within this vertex zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will look at the zone created by vertex $\\mathbf{v_4}$. First, we will calculate the corresponding $\\mathbf{A}$ matrix, which we will call $\\mathbf{P}$. The values for matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ are found to be the corresponding edges to vertex $\\mathbf{v_4}$ in the direction pointing away from the vertex. By looking at $\\mathbf{N_{vert}}$, we see that edges $\\mathbf{e_3}$, $\\mathbf{e_8}$, and $\\mathbf{e_9}$ correspond with vertex $\\mathbf{v_4}$. For $\\mathbf{e_3}$, we see that $\\mathbf{v_4}$ is in the second column of $\\mathbf{N_{vert}}$, which tells us that the vector $\\mathbf{e_3}$ is pointing towards $\\mathbf{v_4}$, so we need to take the negative of vector $\\mathbf{e_3}$ when calculating $\\mathbf{P}$. For $\\mathbf{e_8}$ and $\\mathbf{e_9}$, $\\mathbf{v_4}$ is in the first column of $\\mathbf{N_{vert}}$, which tells us that the vectors $\\mathbf{e_8}$ and $\\mathbf{e_9}$ are pointing away from $\\mathbf{v_4}$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{P}$ is found to be:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{P} = \\begin{bmatrix*}[r] -\\mathbf{e_3}\\\\ \\mathbf{e_8}\\\\ \\mathbf{e_9} \\end{bmatrix*} = \\begin{bmatrix*}[r] 0&0&2\\\\ -2&0&0\\\\ 0&-2&0 \\end{bmatrix*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can calculate the corresponding $\\mathbf{a}$ vector, which we will call $\\mathbf{p}$. The values in $\\mathbf{p}$ are calculated by taking the dot product between each plane in $\\mathbf{P}$ with a point that lies on the respective plane. For vertex zones, the corresponding vertex lies in all the planes in $\\mathbf{P}$. We have to keep in mind that the origin of our periodic box is different from the origin we set when defining our vertices, so we have to add the position of the cube to our vertex. For our example, $\\mathbf{p}$ is found to be:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{v_4} + \\begin{bmatrix} 3&3&3 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix*}[r] 0&0&2\\\\ -2&0&0\\\\ 0&-2&0 \\end{bmatrix*} \\begin{bmatrix*}[r] 4\\\\ 4\\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix*} = \\begin{bmatrix*}[r] 4\\\\ -8\\\\ -8 \\end{bmatrix*}$$\n",
